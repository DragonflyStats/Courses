\begin{itemize}
\item Twenty-five machine operators produce items that are sometimes
defective. 
\item Random samples of the production of each operator give the number of
defective items each produces out of 10 items sampled. 
\end{itemize}

These numbers are as below:

\begin{verbatim}
2 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 3 0 1 2 0 0
1 3 1 2 0
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}


Do these results give enough evidence to show that the operators do not all have a 10\%
rate of producing defective items?

We suppose that each operator is independent of the others, and that items are
produced independently of each other, and that the rate of production of defective
items is constant for each operator. The Null Hypothesis is that the rate of production
of defective items is 10\% for each operator. Then each of the numbers in the table
